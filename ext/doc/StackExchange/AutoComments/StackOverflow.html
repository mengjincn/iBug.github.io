			<p>###[Q] RegEx Two Problems
<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/regular-expressions-now-you-have-two-problems/">Now you have two problems.</a></p>

<p>###[Q] Code as image
<a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/285551/5958455">Please don’t post your code as an image.</a></p>

<p>###[Q] “It doesn’t work” with no exception/error details
Can you elaborate on how your code “doesn’t work”? What were you expecting, and what actually happened? If you got an exception/error, post the line it occurred on and the exception/error details. Please [edit] these details in or we may not be able to help.</p>

<p>###[Q] “Why won’t it work?” questions with no code
It seems you have a problem with your code. However, we can’t help unless we have <a href="//$SITEURL$/help/mcve">code or information that can reproduce the problem</a>. Otherwise, we are just blindly guessing.</p>

<p>###[Q] Homework question without effort
Questions asking for homework help must include a summary of the work you’ve done so far to solve the problem, and a description of the difficulty you are having solving it. Please read <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/334822/5958455">How to ask homework questions</a> and [edit] your post.</p>

<p>###[Q] Close &gt; unclear what you’re asking
Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it’s currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you’re asking. See the [ask] page for help clarifying this question.</p>

<p>###[Q] How to debug small programs
See <a href="https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/">How to debug small programs</a>.</p>

<p>###Vandalism (SO)

<p>###[A] Code only answer
Thank you for this code snippet, which might provide some limited, immediate help. A <a href="//meta.stackexchange.com/q/114762/350567">proper explanation would greatly improve its long-term value</a> by showing <em>why</em> this is a good solution to the problem, and would make it more useful to future readers with other, similar questions. Please [edit] your answer to add some explanation, including the assumptions you’ve made.</p>

<p>###[A] How not to be a spammer
Please note if you want to promote your own product, website or blog, <strong>you must disclose your affiliation in the answer</strong>. Otherwise, your answer may be flagged as spam. If you are not affiliated with the site, I recommend saying so to prevent this. Please read <a href="https://$SITEURL$/help/promotion">How to not be a spammer</a>.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; Link-only answer (and not spam)
While this link may answer the question, <a href="//meta.stackexchange.com/q/8231">it is better</a> to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; Commentary on another post
This does not provide an answer to the question. Once you have sufficient <a href="/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a> you will be able to <a href="/help/privileges/comment">comment on any post</a>; instead, <a href="//meta.stackexchange.com/q/214173/350567">provide answers that don’t require clarification from the asker</a>.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; Commentary on another post (enough rep)
This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; ‘Thank you’ comment
Please don’t add “thank you” as an answer. Once you have sufficient <a href="/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a>, you will be able to <a href="/help/privileges/vote-up">vote up questions and answers</a> that you found helpful.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; Question as an answer
If you have a new question, please ask it by clicking the <a href="/questions/ask">Ask Question</a> button. Include a link to this question if it helps provide context.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; “I’m having this problem, too” comment.
This does not really answer the question. If you have a different question, you can ask it by clicking <a href="/questions/ask">Ask Question</a>. You can also <a href="/help/privileges/set-bounties">add a bounty</a> to draw more attention to this question once you have enough <a href="/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a>.</p>
