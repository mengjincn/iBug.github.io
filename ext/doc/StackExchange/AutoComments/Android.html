			<p>###[Q] Close &gt; unclear what you’re asking
Please clarify your specific problem or add additional details to highlight exactly what you need. As it’s currently written, it’s hard to tell exactly what you’re asking. See the [ask] page for help clarifying this question.</p>

<p>###[Q] Android.SE &gt; Off-topic &gt; Development question
Questions about <strong>writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers</strong> are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of <a href="https://android.meta.stackexchange.com/q/371/205764">other resources</a> that may be appropriate for your question.</p>

<p>###[Q] Android.SE &gt; Off-topic &gt; Recommendation
Questions asking us to <strong>find or recommend an app, device, ROM, accessory or off-site resource</strong> are off-topic for Android Enthusiasts as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam and become obsolete quickly. <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/23/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/">Instead, describe your situation and the specific problem you’re trying to solve.</a></p>

<p>###[A] General
This is a Q&amp;A site, <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/92107/350567">not a forum</a>. Please use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post Answer</code> button only if you have a solution to the problem. If you have a <strong>new</strong> question, please ask it by clicking <a href="/questions/ask">Ask Question</a>. Once you have sufficient <a href="/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a>, <a href="/help/privileges/vote-up">you can vote up</a> the question. Alternatively, “star” it as a favorite and you will be notified of any new answers.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; ‘Thank you’ comment
Please don’t add “thank you” as an answer. Once you have sufficient <a href="/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a>, you will be able to <a href="/help/privileges/vote-up">vote up questions and answers</a> that you found helpful.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; Link-only answer (and not spam)
While this link may answer the question, <a href="//meta.stackexchange.com/q/8231">it is better</a> to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; Commentary on another post, not an answer
This does not provide an answer to the question. Once you have sufficient <a href="/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a> you will be able to <a href="/help/privileges/comment">comment on any post</a>; instead, <a href="//meta.stackexchange.com/q/214173/">provide answers that don’t require clarification from the asker</a>.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; Question as an answer
If you have a new question, please ask it by clicking the <a href="/questions/ask">Ask Question</a> button. Include a link to this question if it helps provide context.</p>

<p>###[A] NAA &gt; “I’m having this problem, too” comment.
This does not really answer the question. If you have a different question, you can ask it by clicking <a href="/questions/ask">Ask Question</a>. You can also <a href="/help/privileges/set-bounties">add a bounty</a> to draw more attention to this question once you have enough <a href="/help/whats-reputation">reputation</a>.</p>
